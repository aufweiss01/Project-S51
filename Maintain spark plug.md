# Maintain spark plug

## Context
The spark plug should be maintained at least every 3000 km. Checking and maintaining the spark plug is also the starting point for troubleshooting in many cases of combustion-related issues, e.g. if the motor does not start, although fuel is supplied and ignition is switched on. 

## Safety
==**NOTICE**==

**Excessive mechanical force**

The spark plug is partly composed of fragile materials and parts. Applying excessive force might damage the plug.
- Apply force reasonably.
- If required, use a soft cloth to protect the ceramics from being damaged, e.g. when held with pliers. 

## Tools
|Count|Name|Size|
|---|---|---|
|1|Feeler gauge|0.4 mm|
|1|Pliers||
|1|Wire brush||
|1|Flat-bladed screwdriver|small|
|1|Soft cloth||

## Prerequisites
[] The spark plug is removed from the cylinder head.

## Procedure
1. Remove crude pollution, e.g. sooty particles, oil remnants, etc., from the plug part below the screw thread. Use a wire brush or a flat-bladed screw driver.
1. Adjust the electrode spacing.
	1. Check the electrode spacing. Use a feeler gauge, 0.4 mm.
	1. Continue depending on your findings:
		- The spacing equals 0.4 mm: Continue with the next step.
		- The spacing does not equal 0.4 mm: Continue with the next substep.
	1. Carefully bend the ground electrode to increase or decrease the electrode spacing to 0.4 mm. Use appropriate tools, e.g. pliers or a flat-bladed screwdriver.
	1. Repeat the entire step.
1. Check the spark plug for indicators of combustion quality.
	1. **==NOTICE== Deficient illumination might confound your judgement.**  
	Check the plug part below the screw thread for colored remnants.
	1. Continue depending on your findings:
		- The plug is fawn brown: Finish the procedure.
		- The plug is whitish or very dark: Continue with [Troubleshooting spark plug]().
